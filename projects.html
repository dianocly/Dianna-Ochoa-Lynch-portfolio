                    <h3>Project details, requirements, and responsibilities</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Design, manufacture, and control a robust, highly anthropomorphic robotic hand for the purpose of teleoperation.</li>
                        <li>Embed multi-tendon actuation to precisely mimic all functions of a human hand and enable fine precision control in a wide range of settings.</li>
                        <li>Create a robust, long-lasting, open-source solution that can be adapted to many forms of robotics.</li>
                        <li>Make the finger fully serviceable: joints and tendons must be easy to assemble, replace, and tune.</li>
                        <li>Oversee fabrication of the hand components and prototypes, including manual and CNC milling and turning, 3D printing, laser cutting, and waterjet parts.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Process and iterations</h3>
                    <p><strong>Parametric geometry (concept and layout)</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed a parametric 2D sketch for joint spacing and phalanx lengths to control the closing trajectory and stiffness profile.</li>
                        <li>Embedded torque calculations into 2D parametric geometry to visualize and optimize tendon placement.</li>
                        <li>Used this sketch to generate 3D link shapes and joint bosses, allowing rapid iteration on link length ratios and tendon anchor locations.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Prototype 1 – basic kinematics</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designed and manufactured an oversized model of a simple 3-link finger with printed pulleys and an n+1 tendon system between links.</li>
                        <li>Verified the kinematic behavior: joint coupling, overall range of motion, and basic grasp shapes around objects.</li>
                        <li>Identified redesign locations, including:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Protruding pulleys that interrupted the finger profile, impeding operation and anthropomorphic accuracy.</li>
                                <li>Inaccuracies in the parametric calculations that led to high torque requirements.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Prototype 2 – thumb joint prototype and routing</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designed and developed a prototype for an extra degree-of-freedom thumb design to capture additional abduction/adduction motion.</li>
                        <li>Incorporated adjustable motor mounting to combat cable creep and ease assembly.</li>
                        <li>Improved tendon retention points to avoid slippage under load.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Prototype 3 – capstan-actuated linkages</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Redesigned the actuation mechanism to operate using capstan friction around joint pulleys.</li>
                        <li>Rerouted cables through and around central points of actuation, preventing variability in tension during operation and simplifying the control scheme.</li>
                        <li>Redesigned mounting and motor placement to slim the design package and allow for future multi-finger integration.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Prototype 4 – serviceable Mk1 finger design</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Finalized a Mk1 serviceable finger with complete actuation and an accurately sized package.</li>
                        <li>Personally CNC-machined phalanges and joints for assembly.</li>
                        <li>Created a model tendon system that can be adapted to other finger and thumb designs.</li>
                        <li>Prepared exploded views and basic drawings so the finger can be integrated into a larger hand as a standard module.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Future project scope</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This project is ongoing, and I plan to continue to pursue it alongside my education.
                            As this project continues, we hope to expand the finger design into a larger full-scale
                            hand, incorporating a novel multi-stage capstan gearbox to create high-precision,
                            low-backlash control. We then plan to build a full teleoperation control scheme,
                            ideally integrating haptic feedback and response for high-precision applications,
                            including surgery.

                        <li>
                            Game: FRC 2024 <em>Crescendo</em> – acquire foam “notes” from the floor, cycle them through the speaker/amp,
                            and climb/trap on the stage for high endgame value.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Architecture: swerve drive chassis with a front over-the-bumper intake, note elevator,
                            and climber/trap integration designed for aggressive driving and high contact around the stage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>My role:</strong> Lead designer and lead systems engineer for the robot’s mechanical systems
                            (intake, arm, note path, climber, spares and maintenance); I did not own any programming.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Outcome: Cadenza won the <strong>Industrial Design Award sponsored by General Motors</strong>
                            at the 2024 FRC World Championship for balancing performance, reliability, and serviceability.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>System-level goals</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Design an intake and note path that could reliably acquire notes from messy mid-field piles and tight corners.</li>
                        <li>Ensure the robot could survive repeated high-speed collisions with the stage, other robots, and field elements.</li>
                        <li>
                            Make the intake/arm assembly modular and serviceable so damaged parts could be swapped quickly
                            during long events and at Worlds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Coordinate subsystem design so programmers could focus on autos and trap routines without fighting
                            inconsistent mechanical behavior.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Process and iterations – intake and note acquisition</h3>

                    <p><strong>Baseline intake and early issues</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The early intake could pull notes in, but testing showed inconsistent launch behavior and limited
                            ability to spin rollers up before engaging the note.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Teams observed that light compliant wheels were not fully using the torque available from the motor,
                            and that the geometry gave a weak overbite and shallow wrap on the note.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On-field behavior exposed problems: unreliable centering, weak grip when hitting other robots,
                            and geometry that made stage collisions more likely.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>V2 intake concept – wider aperture and controlled overbite</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Worked with subsystem leads to set design targets for a V2 intake:
                            significantly wider effective capture width, stronger note retention, and easier tuning.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Increased the effective intake width by roughly 14 inches through geometry
                            changes and side-plate redesign, enabling intake from more oblique angles.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Specified a new roller layout using green paddle wheels and tuned overbite to improve initial
                            contact and centering without stalling the note.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Switched to a robust 15:1 UltraPlanetary configuration driving four 16T #25 sprockets, trading
                            a small amount of top speed for reliable torque and predictable current behavior.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Added and tuned a bottom HDPE plate to support notes consistently and avoid jamming at the
                            transition into the elevator.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Refinement and on-robot tuning</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Coordinated testing sessions and requested intake videos to verify that on-robot performance
                            matched bench testing, especially under autonomous operation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Worked with the programming team to tune the intake’s current spike behavior so notes are
                            “bitten” firmly without grinding or ejecting under collision.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Iterated on small but critical details: button-head hardware to avoid interference with trap wheels,
                            chain routing for reliability, and roller shaft spacing for consistent note feed-through.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Verified that the new intake could acquire notes from the side and while brushing other robots,
                            while keeping them secure during full-speed hits.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                                Replaced the previous over-tight 18T belt pulley with a correctly sized 17T version to achieve

                            Helped define the spare strategy for intake and arm: backup shafts, bottom plates, “flex packs,”
                            wrist inserts, encoder gears, and plates were fabricated and staged.

                        <li>
                            How to think like a systems engineer: every intake change touches autos, driver strategy,
                            wiring, serviceability, and even how we pack spares for a week-long event.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How to push meaningful mechanical redesigns (like the V2 intake and full arm rebuild)
                            very late in a season without destabilizing the robot for competition.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How reliability and maintainability are just as visible to judges and alliance partners
                            as raw scoring output – and how that translates into awards at the world-championship level.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Conceptually design an upper-limb exoskeleton augmentation suit for firefighters that
                            reduces fatigue and increases strength during demanding tasks in structural fire environments.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Project scope was <strong>analytical and conceptual only</strong>:
                            the system was modeled in Inventor and MATLAB and was not physically fabricated or tested.
                        </li>
                        <li>Heat resistance: operate up to ~90 °C with safety margin.</li>
                        <li>Flexibility and dexterity: preserve a wide range of motion so standard firefighting techniques remain possible.</li>
                        <li>Weight and ergonomics: minimize added burden on the firefighter’s shoulders, back, and arms.</li>
                        <li>Water and chemical resistance: withstand exposure to water, foam, and chemicals common in firefighting environments.</li>
                        <li>
                            Compatibility with existing PPE: integrate under turnout gear and SCBA without interfering with
                            donning, doffing, or access to existing tools.
                        </li>
                        <li>Cost-effectiveness: pursue a concept that could be manufactured without exotic, cost-prohibitive components.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>
                            Completed as the final project for the MITES Semester Applied Mathematics course, focusing on
                            modeling a human-assist system with realistic constraints using mathematical tools rather than
                            building hardware.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Framed the work around: (1) defining engineering design criteria, (2) proposing a dielectric
                            elastomer “muscle” architecture, and (3) evaluating behavior through MATLAB models informed by Inventor geometry.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Design criteria via firefighter interview</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Consulted with a member of the North Carolina White Cross Fire Department to establish concrete
                            criteria for safety, ergonomics, and integration into real fireground operations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Translated qualitative needs (comfort, mobility, survivability under heat, compatibility with
                            gear) into quantitative design constraints on temperature, range of motion, added mass, and
                            allowed bulk under PPE.

                            Selected VHB 4910 as the dielectric elastomer, sandwiched between carbon-grease electrodes to
                            form artificial “muscle fibers” that expand and contract under applied voltage and can tolerate
                            elevated temperatures.

                        <li>
                            Conceptualized multi-layer “muscle bundles” encapsulated in fire-resistant textiles and
                            positioned along major upper-arm and forearm muscle groups so actuation directions align with
                            natural joint motion.

                            Mapped actuator locations and orientations to human anatomy to support lifting, bracing,
                            and tool-handling motions without fighting the firefighter’s natural movement.

                                <li>Removed the hopper entirely and replaced the manipulator with an open-source intake design from FRC 111 (Wildstang), allowing direct ground intake.</li>
                                <li>Simplified the arm’s path through the robot, reducing collision risk and cleaning up the state machine logic.</li>

                    <h3>Project details and requirements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Game: FTC 2022–23 <em>PowerPlay</em> – pick and place cones onto junctions at multiple heights to create circuits.</li>
                        <li>Chassis: compact 13"×13" mecanum base, able to slip between dense field junctions and move in any direction.</li>
                        <li>Manipulator: coaxial virtual four-bar with wrist control mounted on linear slides, capable of reaching every junction.</li>
                        <li>Constraints: stay within FTC size limits, maintain a low center of gravity, and ensure mechanisms can be serviced between matches.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Process and iterations (by slide focus)</h3>

                    <p><strong>Concept – mecanum base and coaxial virtual four-bar</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Based the drivetrain on a modified goBILDA Strafer chassis, optimized for compact packaging and predictable holonomic control.</li>
                        <li>Designed a coaxial virtual 4-bar mounted on ViperSlides to reach low, medium, and high junctions without overextending beyond the robot’s footprint.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Version 1 – servo and gear-based coaxial drive</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used goBILDA Speed servos driving through a central shaft for the virtual four-bar and wrist rotation.</li>
                        <li>Powered the arm with goBILDA Torque servos on a 3:1 reduction for sufficient holding torque at high reach.</li>
                        <li>Relied on goBILDA ViperSlides for linear extension to reach distant junctions.</li>
                        <li>Outcome: functional but tall; servo placement and metal geartrains produced a high center of gravity and made the robot tippy.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Carriage redesign – lowering CG and re-packaging</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added wooden side plates which:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Provided new mounting faces to lower wrist servos on both sides.</li>
                                <li>Allowed arm servos to be moved lower and closer to the robot’s center.</li>
                                <li>Made it possible to remove heavy metal gears and replace them with custom 3D-printed pulleys.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Introduced a carbon-fiber coaxial shaft to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reduce the weight of the 18" arm assembly.</li>
                                <li>Transfer torque from the central pulley to printed arm adapters while keeping mass off the outer links.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Finite Element Analysis – “Pregnant Alien” carriage</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used Autodesk Inventor’s FEA to analyze side-plate stress under combined rotational and applied forces.</li>
                        <li>Generated a weight-reduced mesh that preserved material in high-stress regions and removed it from low-stress zones.</li>
                        <li>The resulting shape – nicknamed the “Pregnant Alien” – cut mass while preserving stiffness where needed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Performance issues at scrimmage</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arm servos could not rotate the arm fast enough, limiting cycle time.</li>
                        <li>The belt from the arm servos slipped under moment load and could not handle sideloading from tension.</li>
                        <li>Carbon-fiber tubes relying on friction to transmit torque slipped under arm moments, causing positional drift.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Carriage redesign 2 – motorization and chain drive</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Replaced the arm servos with a goBILDA Yellow Jacket motor to increase both speed and torque margin.</li>
                        <li>Replaced the belt with chain off a bevel gear to eliminate skipping and better manage sideloading.</li>
                        <li>Connected the chain directly to new arm adapters, fully removing the slipping carbon-tube interface.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Global ranking and impact</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>From an FTC Stats database of nearly 7,000 teams worldwide, Glacier achieved:
                            <ul>
                                <li>4th overall world ranking.</li>

                        <li>Self-taught CAD in SketchUp and Fusion 360 to create 3D models and presentation drawings.</li>
                        <li>Submitted the design to a civil engineering contest, receiving first place.</li>
                        <li>Appointed lead designer as the project moved toward real implementation:
                            <ul>
